Setting up

What have I learnt?
Learned how to fork a repository on GitHub and then cloned it to my computer

Use in practice?
Followed along live with the instructor for some basic real-time use

Found hard?
It was all fairly straightforward as the instructions were clear, I just didn't really understand WHY we were doing a lot of it! But I'm aware I'm getting ahead of myself, but I love doing that.
