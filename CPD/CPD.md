CPD activity
Setting up

What have I learnt?
Learned how to fork a repository (forking is when you make a copy of a repository, which you can then make changes to without effecting the original) on GitHub and then cloned it to my computer.

Use in practice?
Followed along live with the instructor for some basic real-time use. A couple of days later I then went back to update my CPD file on Visual Studio Code, then "pushed" these changes to GitHub, which is essentislly taking the info from your own repository i.e. then one on your laptop, and uploads it to a remote one. It's definitely much easier when there's someone showing you exactly how to do it! Luckily, when you're on your own the internet provides.

Found hard?
It was all fairly straightforward as the instructions were clear, but at the same time I still have a million and one questions I want to ask. But I feel like we'd need another 2 hours just to cover them all...
