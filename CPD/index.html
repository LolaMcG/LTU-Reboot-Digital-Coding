    <h3>Laura A McGarvey</h3>
    <img src="https:via.placeholder.com/150" alt="">
    <p>I'm Laura, from Scotland. Currently living outside Edinburgh. I quit my job recently cos it made me miserable and am now hoping that coding is going to revolutionise my life. Fingers crossed, eh?</p>

    <h4>Setting up</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Learned how to fork a repository (forking is when you make a copy of a repository, which you can then make changes to without effecting the original) on GitHub and then cloned it to my computer.</p>
    <h5>Use in practice?</h5>
    <p>Followed along live with the instructor for some basic real-time use. A couple of days later I then went back to update my CPD file on Visual Studio Code, then "pushed" these changes to GitHub, which is essentislly taking the info from your own repository i.e. then one on your laptop, and uploads it to a remote one. It's definitely much easier when there's someone showing you exactly how to do it! Luckily, when you're on your own the internet provides.</p>
    <h5>Found hard?</h5>
    <p>It was all fairly straightforward as the instructions were clear, but at the same time I still have a million and one questions I want to ask. But I feel like we'd need another 2 hours just to cover them all...</p>

    <h4>Github Process</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Today we covered a bunch of things. First off Luke told us about some useful free resources to use online to help with our coding journey. These included:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Scrimba</li>
    <li>Mimo - this is an app</li>
    <li>Sololearn - lots of free courses</li>
    <li>W3 schools - I'll admit I'd already looked at this one but didn't like it much. Probably worth going back for another look, though.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then he covered a fair few useful YouTube channels we could be using (it is insane how many free resources there are out there!):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Academind</li>
      <li>Code with Ania Kubow</li>
      <li>Visual Studio Code for Beginners</li>
      <li>CodeStackr</li>
      <li>Traversy Media</li>
      <li>The Net Ninja</li>
    </ul>
<p>The most important thing we covered was the GutHub process, though, where we created a repository, cloned to GitHub desktop, added a new branch, did some basic coding, saved, and then deleted everything. Basically taking you through the entire process of starting and deleting a project, from beginning to end.</p>
    <h5>Use in practice?</h5>
    <p>We followed along in realtime with Luke, then, after he had us delete our repositories, we then had to go back and do the process again solo. After that I then went back and did the process over, and over, and over. And over! Hopefully it has stuck?!</p>
    <h5>Found hard?</h5>
    <p>It was difficult trying to remember when to jump about between GitHub.com, GitHub desktop, and VSC. I still lack a fundamental understanding of these programs and what they do so it's difficult keeping it straight in my head what each one does and, therefore, what the logical next step wpuld be. For now, I am going with rote learning: cram the info into my head until I have it memorised, and hopefully the understanding of it will follow one day.</p>
