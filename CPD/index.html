    <h3>Laura A McGarvey</h3>
    <img src="IMG_0013.JPG" height="100" width="100" alt="my eye">
    <p>I'm Laura, from Scotland. Currently living outside Edinburgh. I quit my job recently cos it made me miserable and am now hoping that coding is going to revolutionise my life. Fingers crossed, eh?</p>

    <h4>Setting up</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Learned how to fork a repository (forking is when you make a copy of a repository, which you can then make changes to without effecting the original) on GitHub and then cloned it to my computer.</p>
    <h5>Use in practice?</h5>
    <p>Followed along live with the instructor for some basic real-time use. A couple of days later I then went back to update my CPD file on Visual Studio Code, then "pushed" these changes to GitHub, which is essentially taking the info from your own repository i.e. the one on your laptop, and uploads it to a remote one. It's definitely much easier when there's someone showing you exactly how to do it! Luckily, when you're on your own the internet provides.</p>
    <h5>Found hard?</h5>
    <p>It was all fairly straightforward as the instructions were clear, but at the same time I still have a million and one questions I want to ask. But I feel like we'd need another 2 hours just to cover them all...</p>

    <h3>16/09/2021</h3>
    <h4>Github Process</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Today we covered a bunch of things. First off Luke told us about some useful free resources to use online to help with our coding journey. These included:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Scrimba</li>
    <li>Mimo - this is an app</li>
    <li>Sololearn - lots of free courses</li>
    <li>W3 schools - I'll admit I'd already looked at this one but didn't like it much. Probably worth going back for another look, though.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then he covered a fair few useful YouTube channels we could be using (it is insane how many free resources there are out there!):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Academind</li>
      <li>Code with Ania Kubow</li>
      <li>Visual Studio Code for Beginners</li>
      <li>CodeStackr</li>
      <li>Traversy Media</li>
      <li>The Net Ninja</li>
    </ul>
<p>The most important thing we covered was the GitHub process, though, where we created a repository, cloned to GitHub desktop, added a new branch, did some basic coding, saved, and then deleted everything. Basically taking you through the entire process of starting and deleting a project, from beginning to end.</p>
    <h5>Use in practice?</h5>
    <p>We followed along in realtime with Luke, then, after he had us delete our repositories, we then had to go back and do the process again solo. After that I then went back and did the process over, and over, and over. And over! Hopefully it has stuck?!</p>
    <h5>Found hard?</h5>
    <p>It was difficult trying to remember when to jump about between GitHub.com, GitHub desktop, and VSC. I still lack a fundamental understanding of these programs and what they do so it's difficult keeping it straight in my head what each one does and, therefore, what the logical next step wpuld be. For now, I'm going with rote learning: cram the info into my head until I have it memorised, and hopefully the understanding of it will follow one day.</p>

    <h3>21/09/2021</h3>
    <h4>Using basic HTML</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>
      Today we looked at some different kinds of basic HTML tags and funtions, as well as going over the meaning of tag (the thing that gives a command to the webpage, identifying how you want it to interpret the following data), element (everything that comes inbetween tags), and attribute (this tells us more about an element).
      Basically, HTML is the 1st layer of a webpage and provides the structure - the structure is very important! Essential for accessability, as well as good for SEO; CSS is the 2nd layer and is for presentation and layout; and the 3rd layer is JacaScript and is for functionality.</p>
    <h6>Images</h6>
    <p>
      If you want to add an image, you must state its source. It's also best if you use an alt attribute, which is the text that will appear to describe a picture if it doesn't load. Even if you leave it blank, it's still best practice to include one.</p>
      <p>e.g. <img src="fabby-abby.jpg" alt="beautiful Abney" height="120" width="100">
    </p>
    <h6>Links</h6>
    <p>
      Links need an anchor tag, the path that the link will take you down, and the text that the user will click.</p>
      <p>e.g. Click<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/">here</a> to open Google. (Clicking this link will override the page you are on and take you to Google in the same tab)</p>
    <h6>Links in a new tab</h6>
    <p>
      To open a link in a new tab you simply add target="_blank" to your anchor tag.</p>
      <p>
        e.g. Click <a href="https://www.google.co.uk" target="_blank">here</a> to open Google in a new tab.
      </p>
    <h6>Email links</h6>
    <p>
      To add an email link just add mailto: after the href attribute. This will open the default email program on a person's computer. However, apparently this is not the best way to set up emailing as can lead to spam. Don't understand how/why yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      e.g. Click here to <a href="mailto:me@example.com">send email</a>.
    </p>
    <h6>Phone links</h6>
    <p>
      Similar to email links, you just add tele: after the href attribute. You don't need to include dashes or spaces, but you can if it makes it visually easier for you; the browser will still be able to understand the code either way.
    </p>
    <p>
      e.g. Click here to <a href="tele:01234567890">call</a> now!
    </p>
    <h6>Comments</h6>
    <p>
      Wrapping text in <! --   --> (but without the space after the !) allows you to leave comments for yourself or other people within your code, without being displayed by the browser. Useful for if you're stepping away from a project for a bit, or working on a group project.
    </p>
    <h5>Use in practice?</h5>
    <p>
      Followed along in realtime, and have since been doing some basic HTML challenges online which use these skills. As you can see, I've also used them in my CPD here!</p>
    <h5>Found difficult?</h5>
    <p>
      To be honest, I didn't find today's lesson very hard, but that's because I'd already learnt most of it previously through solo study. So that's good! Always good to have a bit more explanation about things, though, and going over stuff again and again until it sticks in my head is no bad thing. The most difficult thing will be actually remembering it all longterm...
